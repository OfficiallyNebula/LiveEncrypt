# LiveEncrypt
Live Encrypt is a project to change any string value into an encrypted value where the decryption key is only stored on the users machine.

## Installation
Compile Program.cs in a console .net application and run in release.

## Usage
```
- First run prompts user to set their Hash method
```
```
- Takes user input (string)
```
```
- Encrypts value using custom hash method selected
```
```
- Stores file 'Encryption.neb' in project source location (This includes all encrypted strings, just delete the file or open file and remove anything you don't want stored locally)
```
```
- Decryption happens when user is wanting to implement their string
```

## Contributing
